/*
    order of data:
    
    origin, destination, aircraft, departure, arrival
    
    This requires a lookup in table aircraft to find the associated ID
    values for column aircraft.
  
    An example insert statement would be:
  
    INSERT INTO flight (origin, destination, aircraft, departure, arrival) VALUES
    ('AAA', 'BBB', 20,'2020-10-06 09:00:00', '2021-04-01 08:00:00');
